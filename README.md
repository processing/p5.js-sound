p5.sound brings the [Processing](http://processing.org) approach to [Web Audio](http://w3.org/TR/webaudio/) as an addon for [p5.js](http://github.com/processing/p5.js). Functionality includes audio input, playback, manipulation, effects, recording, sequencing, analysis and synthesis. The library is designed to be used in tandem with [p5.js](http://p5js.org).

Between February 2023 - July 2023, this repository is being maintained by aarón montoya-moraga (@montoyamoraga), in their role of Processing p5.js sound Fellow.

Note : If you have any questions or concerns regarding the project, you can reach out to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/HWzy4HpaEJ) and [Gitter](https://gitter.im/processing/p5.js-sound) communities. The p5.js team closely monitors all pull requests and issues on GitHub, so there's no need to also post them on Discord.

### Dependencies

p5.sound is built with a few modules (Clock, TimelineSignal, and signal math components) from [Tone.js](https://github.com/tonejs/Tone.js), an interactive music framework developed by Yotam Mann.
