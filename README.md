During December 2023 we are sunsetting, archiving and deprecating this repository and version of the p5.sound project, while we prepare the release of the new version of the library, currently being built at [https://github.com/processing/p5.sound.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.sound.js).

p5.sound brings the [Processing](http://processing.org) approach to [Web Audio](http://w3.org/TR/webaudio/) as an addon for [p5.js](http://github.com/processing/p5.js). Functionality includes audio input, playback, manipulation, effects, recording, sequencing, analysis and synthesis. The library is designed to be used in tandem with [p5.js](http://p5js.org).

Between February 2023 - December 2023, this repository was  maintained by aar√≥n montoya-moraga (@montoyamoraga), in their role of Processing p5.js sound Fellow.

### Contribute

Here's a guide to contribute to the p5.js project https://github.com/processing/p5.js-sound/wiki/Contribute, to help you getting started as a contributor.

Note : If you have any questions or concerns regarding the project, you can reach out to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/HWzy4HpaEJ) and [Gitter](https://gitter.im/processing/p5.js-sound) communities. The p5.js team closely monitors all pull requests and issues on GitHub, so there's no need to also post them on Discord. Additionally, conversations about specific pull requests and issues should take place on GitHub, to ensure that people following along over can see and take part in the whole discussion.

### Dependencies

p5.sound is built with a few modules (Clock, TimelineSignal, and signal math components) from [Tone.js](https://github.com/tonejs/Tone.js), an interactive music framework developed by Yotam Mann.
