/**
 * Example: Amplitude Modulation involves two oscillators, referred
 * to as the carrier and the modulator, where the modulator controls
 * the carrier's amplitude.
 * 
 * The carrier is typically set at an audible frequency (i.e. 440 Hz)
 * and connected to main output by default. The carrier.amp is
 * set to zero because we will have the modulator control its amplitude.
 * 
 * The modulator is typically set to a frequency that is lower than
 * humans can hear (i.e. 1 Hz, or one cycle every second). The modulator
 * is diconnected from main output. Instead, it is connected
 * to the amplitude of the Carrier, like this: carrier.amp(modulator).
 *
 * MouseX controls the amplitude of the modulator from 0 to 1. When the
 * modulator's amplitude is set to 0, the amplitude modulation has no effect.
 * 
 * MouseY controls the frequency of the modulator from 0 to 20hz.
 * Both impact our perception of the Carrier frequency. A subtle amount
 * of Amplitude Modulation can simulate effects such as Tremolo.
 * Ring Modulation is a type of Amplitude Modulation where the original
 * carrier signal is not present.
