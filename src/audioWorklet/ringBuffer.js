 * A JS FIFO implementation for the AudioWorklet. 3 assumptions for the
 * simpler operation:
 *  1. the push and the pull operation are done by 128 frames. (Web Audio
 *    API's render quantum size in the speficiation)
 *  2. the channel count of input/output cannot be changed dynamically.
 *    The AudioWorkletNode should be configured with the `.channelCount = k`
 *    (where k is the channel count you want) and
 *    `.channelCountMode = explicit`.
 *  3. This is for the single-thread operation. (obviously)
